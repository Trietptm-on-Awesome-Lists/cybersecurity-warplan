# El Warplan

*[If you are not curious about something you are dead....Be curious about something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be7bvZkgFmY)*

This is an attempt to build a warplan to become a better security engineer in **one year**. Success would mean I can pass a Cisco, Amazon etc security interview.

As of now I have absolutely no experience in cybersecurity! I have been involved in webdevelopment for last couple of years but I am tabula rasa as far as security is concerned.

I'll try to gather all the resources I find interesting here.

I am still not sure what sort of skills I need so this warplan will be prone to massive editing. And it might be extremely disorganized!

## Hands-on Practice:

### Books I plan on going through:
- All in one CISSP Exam
- Violent Python
- Hacker Playbook 2


### Day 0:
- Checked out **Nmap**. Some of the commands. Started with black hat python book.

### Day 1:
- Started playing around with **vim**. Been using atom but vim seems like a better choice for scripting on servers etc. There is a learning curve. New things I found out and liked:
  - /\c{word} _for case sensitive search_
  - :w | !pyton file.py _to save file and run it without closing it_
  - dd _to delete lines_
  - _v_ to select a word and then _shift_ _v_ _Makes word upper case_
  - open multiple files and then moving around with :prev, :n
  - _<_ to indent blocks
  - Copying lines and pasting
  - Using vim is forcing me to spend more time on terminal, making me more comfortable with common terminal commands
