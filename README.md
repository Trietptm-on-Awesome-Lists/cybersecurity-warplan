# El Warplan

*[If you are not curious about something you are dead....Be curious about something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be7bvZkgFmY)*

This is an attempt to build a warplan to become a better security engineer in **one year**. Success would mean I can pass a Cisco, Amazon etc security interview.

As of now I have absolutely no experience in cybersecurity! I have been involved in webdevelopment for last couple of years but I am tabula rasa as far as security is concerned.

I have decided to start learning from **absolute ZERO!**.

I'll
- Relearn the things I know
- Unlearn the things I shouldn't know
- Learn the things I ought to know

I'll try to gather all the resources here.

I am still not sure what sort of skills I need so this warplan will be prone to massive editing. And it might be extremely disorganized!

   - _"With a lack of cybersecurity talent in the playing field these days, itâ€™s a perfect time to get your start in the sector and set yourself up for lifelong success in a lucrative career."_
   - Solid foundation in computer science: network, os etc _This repo is all about that_
   - Networking _Not yet, don't have anything to show_
   - Earn Certificates _Not sure if I want to do that. May be someday. I am using this repo for the same purpose anyway_
   - Initiative - projects, messing up things etc
   - Be good at data analysis
