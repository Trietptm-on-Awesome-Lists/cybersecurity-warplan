# El Warplan

*[If you are not curious about something you are dead....Be curious about something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be7bvZkgFmY)*

This is an attempt to build a warplan to become a better security engineer in **one year**. Success would mean I can pass a Cisco, Amazon etc security interview.

As of now I have absolutely no experience in cybersecurity! I have been involved in webdevelopment for last couple of years but I am tabula rasa as far as security is concerned.

I have decided to start learning from **absolute ZERO!**.

I'll 
- Relearn the things I know
- Unlearn the things I shouldn't know
- Learn the things I ought to know

I'll try to gather all the resources here.

I am still not sure what sort of skills I need so this warplan will be prone to massive editing. And it might be extremely disorganized!

   - _"With a lack of cybersecurity talent in the playing field these days, itâ€™s a perfect time to get your start in the sector and set yourself up for lifelong success in a lucrative career."_
   - Solid foundation in computer science: network, os etc _This repo is all about that_
   - Networking _Not yet, don't have anything to show_
   - Earn Certificates _Not sure if I want to do that. May be someday. I am using this repo for the same purpose anyway_
   - Initiative - projects, messing up things etc
   - Be good at data analysis

- Problem solving practice

### Books I plan on going through:
- [ ] Black Hat Python _In progress_
- [ ] All in one CISSP Exam
- [ ] Violent Python
- [ ] Hacker Playbook 2

### Day 0:
- Checked out **Nmap**. Some of the commands. Started with black hat python book.

### Day 1:
- Started playing around with **vim**. Been using atom but vim seems like a better choice for scripting on servers etc. There is a learning curve. New things I found out and liked:
  - /\c{word} _for case sensitive search_
  - :w | !pyton file.py _to save file and run it without closing it_
  - dd _to delete lines_
  - _v_ to select a word and then _shift_ _v_ _Makes word upper case_
  - open multiple files and then moving around with :prev, :n
  - _<_ to indent blocks
  - Copying lines and pasting
  - Using vim is forcing me to spend more time on terminal, making me more comfortable with common terminal commands

### Day 2:
- Tower of Hanoi and other recursion problems

### Day 3:
- Cryptography
