# El Warplan

*[If you are not curious about something you are dead....Be curious about something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be7bvZkgFmY)*

This is an attempt to build a warplan to become a better security engineer in **one year**. Success would mean I can pass a Cisco, Amazon etc security interview.

As of now I have absolutely no experience in cybersecurity! I have been involved in webdevelopment for last couple of years but I am tabula rasa as far as security is concerned.

I'll try to gather all the resources I find interesting here.

I am still not sure what sort of skills I need so this warplan will be prone to massive editing. And it might be extremely disorganized!
